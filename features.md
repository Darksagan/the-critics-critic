 * Tech: Recharts, Next.js API routes, static or API data.
 */

/**
 * 7. Sentiment Analysis of Reviews
 * Description: Analyze the language in critic reviews for tone and style.
 * Goal: Identify critics who are overly positive, negative, or hyperbolic.
 * Implementation:
 * - Fetch review text (e.g., Rotten Tomatoes, custom scraping).
 * - Use NLP (e.g., Sentiment library or Hugging Face API) to score positivity/negativity.
 * - UI: A page (`/sentiment`) with critic profiles and sentiment stats.
 * Tech: Node.js NLP libraries, Next.js API routes, external review sources.
 */

/**
 * 8. International Cinema Comparison
 * Description: Compare critic responses to films across countries.
 * Goal: Highlight cultural differences in taste.
 * Implementation:
 * - Source reviews from international critics (e.g., Metacritic, custom data).
 * - Create a comparison page (`/international`) with scores by country.
 * - Visualize with a heat map or bar chart.
 * Tech: Next.js static props, Chart.js, multi-source data aggregation.
 */

/**
 * 9. Film Festival Prediction Model
 * Description: Predict film festival winners based on critic trends.
 * Additional Feature: Track critics aligned with festival juries.
 * Implementation:
 * - Collect historical festival data and critic reviews.
 * - Build a simple ML model (e.g., logistic regression) or heuristic scoring.
 * - UI: A page (`/festivals`) with predictions and critic alignment stats.
 * Tech: Python (optional for ML), Next.js API routes, static data.
 */

/**
 * 10. Critic Consistency Score
 * Description: Measure critic reliability across genres and time.
 * Goal: Identify consistent vs. erratic critics.
